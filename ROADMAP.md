- [x] 🟡 Add `get_merges()` method to inspect learned merge rules
- [x] 🟡 Implement `__reduce__`/`__setstate__` for pickle support

### Testing & Quality
- [x] 🟢 Add code coverage reporting with codecov
- [x] 🟢 Add Rust unit tests for core functions in lib.rs
- [x] 🟡 Add error handling edge case tests
- [x] 🟡 Set up coverage threshold enforcement in CI

### Documentation
- [x] 🟢 Add troubleshooting section to README
- [x] 🟢 Create CHANGELOG.md with proper versioning history
- [x] 🟢 Add docstrings to all public Rust functions

### Infrastructure
- [x] 🟢 Add issue templates (bug report, feature request)
- [x] 🟢 Add pull request template
- [x] 🟢 Add CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
- [x] 🟢 Add SECURITY.md with vulnerability reporting guidelines

## Won't Do / Out of Scope

Items explicitly not planned for this project:

- **General-purpose BPE**: This tokenizer is specifically designed for SMILES strings. For general text, use [tiktoken](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken) or similar.
- **Training from SMILES files directly**: Users should preprocess their data. The tokenizer trains from in-memory string lists.
- **GUI/Web interface**: This is a library, not an application.
- **Non-canonical SMILES normalization**: Canonicalization should be done before tokenization using RDKit or similar.
- **Reaction SMILES support**: Focus is on molecule SMILES. Reaction handling (with `>>`) may produce unexpected results.
- **SELFIES support**: Different representation format; consider [selfies](https://github.com/aspuru-guzik-group/selfies) library instead.
